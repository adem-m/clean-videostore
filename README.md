## Additional information
Customer class has been split in 3 subclasses:

- Customer
- Statement
- AmountComputer

Each class has its test class.
I removed the original test class and divided its methods in several classes.
I tried to make methods as short as possible. The biggest one is 17 lines long.
I used STATIC_VARIABLES instead of "magic numbers" to make the code more readable.
I also tried to make the code maintainable and evolutive.
